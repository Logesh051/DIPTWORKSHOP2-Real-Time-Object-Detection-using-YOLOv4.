### Title: Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv4

### Description:
This project performs real-time object detection using a pretrained YOLOv4 model through your laptop camera. The system loads YOLOv4 weights, configuration files, and COCO class labels to detect objects in live video.

### Features:
• Real-time detection from webcam
• Uses YOLOv4 pretrained model
• Displays bounding boxes and confidence scores
• Supports COCO dataset object names

### Requirements:
• Python 3
• OpenCV
• NumPy
• YOLOv4 files: yolov4.weights, yolov4.cfg, coco.names

### How to Run:

Place all YOLOv4 files in the project folder.

1.Install required packages
2.Run the Python script

### Code Used:


### Output:


### Description:
YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once) is a fast and accurate deep learning model for detecting objects in real time. Each frame from your laptop camera is processed through the network to identify objects instantly.
